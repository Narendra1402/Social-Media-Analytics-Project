## Social Media Analytics Project

### Overview

Welcome to my Social Media Analytics project! This project aims to analyze social media data using SQL to gain insights into user interactions, post performance, and overall engagement. The database includes tables for comments, followers, likes, posts, and users.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Database Schema**
   - **Users**: Contains information about users such as user ID, username, and other relevant details.
   - **Posts**: Stores details of each post including post ID, user ID, content, timestamp, etc.
   - **Likes**: Tracks likes on posts with details like like ID, post ID, user ID, and timestamp.
   - **Comments**: Contains comments made on posts with fields like comment ID, post ID, user ID, content, and timestamp.
   - **Followers**: Records follower relationships between users with follower ID and following ID.

2. **SQL Queries**
   - Analyzing the most popular posts based on likes and comments.
   - Identifying users with the highest engagement rates.
   - Examining follower growth over time.
   - Tracking user interaction trends.

### Key Features

- **User Table**
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `username`: User's display name.
  - `email`: User's email address.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of user account creation.

- **Post Table**
  - `post_id`: Unique identifier for each post.
  - `user_id`: ID of the user who created the post.
  - `content`: Text content of the post.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of post creation.

- **Like Table**
  - `like_id`: Unique identifier for each like.
  - `post_id`: ID of the liked post.
  - `user_id`: ID of the user who liked the post.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of the like action.

- **Comment Table**
  - `comment_id`: Unique identifier for each comment.
  - `post_id`: ID of the commented post.
  - `user_id`: ID of the user who commented.
  - `content`: Text content of the comment.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of the comment.

- **Follower Table**
  - `follower_id`: Unique identifier for the follower relationship.
  - `user_id`: ID of the user who is following.
  - `following_id`: ID of the user being followed.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of the follow action.

### Insights and Analytics

By running various SQL queries, this project provides insights such as:

- Top-performing posts based on engagement.
- Users with the most followers.
- Daily, weekly, and monthly engagement trends.
- Patterns in user activity and interaction.
